# Rubber-Froggy
Its a rubber duck but not a duck its a frog that chills on your desktop

## Details
The frog hangs out on your desktop and offers its ear for rubber duck debugging.
It performs the following functions.
- Chills with some idle animations (croak/sleep/heart)
- Hover over him and he will attentively listen to you
- Pick him up and he'll chill on a bamboo shoot
- Drop him from a height and he'll gracefully fall down and resume idling
- No he doesn't jump around, he's meant to be unobtrusive and I'm not good at animation

## Usage
Rubber-Froggy needs python >= 3.8 and uses poetry for dependency management
```shell
# Commands
make main  # runs w/ poetry
make build  # builds single executable file
make format  # does formatting with black
